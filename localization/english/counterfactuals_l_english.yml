#100: Byzantines
  counterfactuals.102.t:0 "Fall of Rome"
  counterfactuals.102.desc:0 "The political turmoil in Greece has proven too much for the ancient empire to bear, precipitating a complete collapse of imperial authority. While [former_byzantine_emperor.GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] still maintains the pretense of being the legitimate Emperor of the Romans, the region has largely devolved into a mess of squabbling lords as local governors are left to fend for themselves.\n\nThere is no telling whether this is a mere setback, or the final end of the great Roman Empire."
  counterfactuals.102.a:0 "Perhaps it is for the best."

  counterfactuals.103.t:0 "Fall of Rome"
  counterfactuals.103.desc:0 "The political turmoil in Greece has proven too much for the ancient empire to bear, precipitating a complete collapse of imperial authority. With [constantinople_holder.GetFullNameRegnal] in control of Constantinople, [former_byzantine_emperor.GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] has lost all legitimacy, leaving the imperial throne effectively vacant.\n\nWith the former lands of the empire devolving into a mess of squabbling lords, the future of region seems to be in the hands of [constantinople_holder.GetPrimaryTitle.GetName] for now."
  counterfactuals.103.desc.mongol:0 "The Great Khan has swept away the ancient empire of the Romans, seizing its lands through brutal conquest. With [former_byzantine_emperor.GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] having fled into exile, the imperial throne has been effectively abolished, and all its former subjects have been forced to bend the knee to [constantinople_holder.GetFullNameRegnal].\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the local lords will accept this new situation, or if the imperial cause will be taken up by a new Greek pretender."
  counterfactuals.103.a:0 "We must adapt to this new reality."
  counterfactuals.103.b:0 "We will drive out the invaders and reforge the empire!"
  counterfactuals.103.c:0 "We are the new masters here!"
  counterfactuals.103.d:0 "Will the empire ever rise again?"

  counterfactuals.104.desc:0 "Having seized the title for [constantinople_holder.GetHerselfHimself], [constantinople_holder.GetFullNameRegnal] has declared that the title of Emperor of the Romans be abolished, and its lands annexed directly into [constantinople_holder.GetPrimaryTitle.GetName].\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the local lords will accept this new status, or if the imperial throne will be taken up by a new Greek pretender."

  counterfactuals.202.kyiv:0 "The Mongol scourge has poured through the Golden Gates of [mongol_sacked_barony.GetNameNoTier] and sacked the once proud trading hub. The city has been left a smoldering ruin and the Dnieper now runs red with the blood of its former inhabitants."
# Mongols sack Novgorod
  counterfactuals.202.novgorod:0 "[mongol_sacked_barony.GetNameNoTier] has been stormed by the Tartar horde and both the city and its population are now suffering beyond measure.

# Mongols sack Krakow
  counterfactuals.202.krakow:0 "The Mongols continue their push beyond the Vistula and into Poland. [mongol_sacked_barony.GetNameNoTier] has now fallen to the invaders, and it is said that at night the flames from the burning city can be seen from untold leagues away."
# Mongols sack Aachen
  counterfactuals.202.aachen:0 "Even [mongol_sacked_barony.GetNameNoTier], the former seat of Charlemagne's great Carolingian empire, has fallen under the shadow of the Mongol scourge. His spirit must surely be weeping at the atrocities now being committed within the city's walls."
# Mongols sack Paris
  counterfactuals.202.paris:0 "Like a swarm of locusts, the unstoppable Mongols have descended upon [mongol_sacked_barony.GetNameNoTier] and sacked the city, setting the still unfinished Notre Dame Cathedral ablaze. Under the light provided by the rest of the burning city, the Mongol warriors continued looting and murdering well into the night."
# Mongols sack London
  counterfactuals.202.london:0 "Not even the sea has proved a formidable enough barrier to halt the Mongol advance. [mongol_sacked_barony.GetNameNoTier] has fallen to their vanguard and the city is now the scene of a slaughter on a scale unrivaled since the days of Queen Boudica and her rebellion."
# Mongols sack Rome
  counterfactuals.202.rome:0 "Once more [mongol_sacked_barony.GetNameNoTier] suffers at the cruel hands of eastern barbarians. The Mongols have breached the Aurelian Walls, and their horses are now grazing on the field of the Circus Maximus while they raise their yurts on the Palatine Hill.\n\nAs expected, no mercy is shown to those Romans who have not yet fled the city. The blood of its former inhabitants runs freely down the gutters and into the Tiber."
# Mongols sack Venice
  counterfactuals.202.venice:0 "The grand canals of [mongol_sacked_barony.GetNameNoTier] have been filled with the bloated corpses of the dead as the city is sacked by frenzied Mongol warriors. The riches of the Doge's Palace were stripped bare and claimed by the Great Khan as the spoils of victory, along with all the remaining ships of the great Venetian navy.\n\nThose few fortunate enough to have escaped the slaughter claim the bodies are packed tightly enough in the Venetian Lagoon for the Mongols to ride to and from the mainland as they please!"
# Mongols sack Constantinople
  counterfactuals.202.constantinople:0 "The Theodosian Walls have not been enough to spare [mongol_sacked_barony.GetNameNoTier] from the vile touch of the Tartar scourge.

# Mongols sack Lisbon
  counterfactuals.202.lisbon:0 "The Mongols have now reached as far west as [mongol_sacked_barony.GetNameNoTier] in their conquests. While the city burns at their touch, the steppe warriors look out over the great blue expanse of the Atlantic.\n\nWho can tell where they will turn next?"
# Mongols sack Smolensk
  counterfactuals.202.smolensk:0 "[mongol_sacked_barony.GetNameNoTier] has been swallowed up by the Mongol hordes as they continue their relentless advance to the west.

# Mongols sack Prague
  counterfactuals.202.prague:0 "The city of [mongol_sacked_barony.GetNameNoTier] has become a beacon of light in an otherwise dark world, as the Mongol barbarians move from house to house and set fire to everything not yet looted.

  counterfactuals.202.vienna:0 "[mongol_sacked_barony.GetNameNoTier], a city of growing importance on the Danube river, has become the latest victim of the Mongol hordes as they continue to pillage and burn their way across Europe.

# Mongols sack Esztergom
  counterfactuals.202.esztergom:0 "The Mongols have reached beyond the Carpathians and fanned out across the Great Hungarian Plain. Now the city of [mongol_sacked_barony.GetNameNoTier] has fallen to the murderous host and is the scene of indiscriminate slaughter.

# Mongols sack Athens
  counterfactuals.202.athens:0 "The ancient city of [mongol_sacked_barony.GetNameNoTier] has fallen to the Mongols, and they now rampage unchecked behind its walls.

# Mongols sack Belgrade
  counterfactuals.202.belgrade:0 "The "White City" has turned red as the Mongol invaders seize [mongol_sacked_barony.GetNameNoTier] and massacre the inhabitants without exception.

# Mongols sack Baghdad
  counterfactuals.202.baghdad:0 "The great city of [mongol_sacked_barony.GetNameNoTier], one of the world's foremost centers of learning, has succumbed to the ravenous Mongol hordes after a siege. Nothing can sate their appetite for destruction it seems. The Tigris river runs not only red with blood, but black with the ink of priceless and irreplaceable tomes from the House of Wisdom and the city's other great libraries.\n\nOnly ruins have been left behind, as if to signal the worth of old knowledge in the new world of the Mongols."
# Mongols sack Damascus
  counterfactuals.202.damascus:0 "[mongol_sacked_barony.GetNameNoTier], the ancient City of Jasmine, has been sacked by the advancing Mongols.

# Mongols sack Jerusalem
  counterfactuals.202.jerusalem:0 "The Tartars have sacked [mongol_sacked_barony.GetNameNoTier] in a cyclone of violence.

The Great Khan's religious tolerance does not extend to [mongol_emperor.GetHerHis] enemies, as evidenced by the columns of smoke now rising over the most holy of cities."
# Mongols sack Alexandria
  counterfactuals.202.alexandria:0 "Not content with their vast empire surpassing Alexander the Great's in sheer size, the Mongol hordes are now laying waste to the city that is his namesake as well. Pompey's Pillar has been toppled, but at least the Pharos Lighthouse was spared when the Mongols deemed it not worth the great effort it would require to raze it to the ground."
# Mongols sack Cairo
  counterfactuals.202.cairo:0 "Riding through the fertile Nile Delta, the Tartar hordes have arrived at the Great Pyramids of Giza and breached the gates of [mongol_sacked_barony.GetNameNoTier].

# Mongols sack Mecca 
  counterfactuals.202.mecca:0 "The Holy City of [mongol_sacked_barony.GetNameNoTier] now burns at the cruel touch of the Mongol infidels.

# Mongols sack Delhi
  counterfactuals.202.delhi:0 "The Mongol hordes have crossed the Indus and sacked [mongol_sacked_barony.GetNameNoTier]!

# Mongols sack Tanjavur
  counterfactuals.202.tanjavur:0 "The great Tamil city of [mongol_sacked_barony.GetNameNoTier] has been pillaged by mongol armies. Brihadeeswarar Temple has been picked clean of all of its relics and treasures, and its grounds desecrated with the blood of holy men."
# Mongols sack Dublin
  counterfactuals.202.dublin:0 "The Mongols continue their conquest across the sea, and have now laid waste to [mongol_sacked_barony.GetNameNoTier] in their insatiable lust for bloodshed. With the port put to the torch, roving gangs of mounted bandits freely terrorize and burn the countryside.\n\nWith the British Isles trampled underhoof, only the Atlantic stands opposed to [mongol_emperor.GetNameRegnal] now."
# Mongols sack Reykjavik
  counterfactuals.202.reykjavik:0 "Even at the edge of the known world, [mongol_sacked_barony.GetNameNoTier] could not escape the grip of mongol terror. Iceland's brutal terrain provides a safe haven for the lucky few who have managed to flee into the hills, but with the port town reduced to ash, they have little hope for future recovery.\n\nUpon hearing tales of even more distant lands to the west, the mongol commander ordered the construction of a fleet that could carry the mongol hordes all the way to Greenland and Vinland. Will this madness never end?"
# Mongols sack Samarkand
  counterfactuals.202.samarkand:0 "The ancient city of [mongol_sacked_barony.GetNameNoTier] has fallen to the Great Khan. The mongol invaders ransacked the city and forced all of its skilled craftsmen into slavery to serve their growing empire.

# Mongols raze Nishapur
  counterfactuals.202.nishapur:0 "The Great Khan has chosen to make an example of [mongol_sacked_barony.GetNameNoTier], ordering the city completely destroyed in a brutal 10 days of carnage.

# Mongols sack Timbuktu
  counterfactuals.202.timbuktu:0 "The Mongols have crossed the Sahara and brought their reign of destruction unto [mongol_sacked_barony.GetNameNoTier].

# Mongols sack Dagon
  counterfactuals.202.dagon:0 "The spiritual center of [mongol_sacked_barony.GetNameNoTier] burned for five days after the mongols were done looting its temples and shrines. None could escape the tartar savagery, even the sturdy Shwedagon Pagoda that has stood for centuries was severely damaged in the carnage.\n\nWith the Indian Ocean to their south, and the dense jungles looming in the east, have the Mongols finally conquered to the ends of the earth?"
# Mongols sack Cordoba
  counterfactuals.202.cordoba:0 "The jewel of Al-Andalus has been sundered by the ever-advancing Mongols. Those who failed to flee into the countryside have been tortured and executed at the whims of the barbarians. The Great Mosque is said to be piled high with the bodies of the dead."
