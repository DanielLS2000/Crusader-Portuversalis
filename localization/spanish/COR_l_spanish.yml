This act not only isolates [COR_ruler.GetTitledFirstName] from the spiritual embrace of the Church but also casts a long shadow over the realm, leaving its future intertwined with the uncertain fate of a sovereign now severed from the divine guidance that once legitimized their reign. The consequences of this day, marked by an act of sheer will and rebellion, are sure to unfold in the annals of history, as the kingdom grapples with the rift between crown and cross."

 CHLAMYS_GLOSS: "The chlamys (Ancient Greek: χλαμύς, chlamýs, genitive: χλαμύδος, chlamydos) was a type of an ancient Greek cloak. By the time of the Byzantine Empire it was part of the state costume of the emperor and high officials. It survived as such until at least the 12th century AD."
 EKTENIA_GLOSS: "An ektenia (from Greek: ἐκτενής, romanized: ektenés; literally, "diligence"), often called by the better known English word litany, consists of a series of petitions occurring in the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic liturgies."
 KOUBOUKLEISIOI_GLOSS: "Koubukleisios (Greek: κουβουκλείσιος) was a title conferred by the Byzantine emperors on ecclesiastic chamberlains, especially those of the Patriarch of Constantinople.\nThe kouboukleisioi were an ecclesiastic analogue to the emperors' own chamber servants, the koubikoularioi, and the title was conferred by the emperors, although in the 11th century the powerful Patriarch Michael Keroularios assumed this prerogative for himself.\nAccording to the Taktikon Benešević of ca. 934/944, there were two groups of kouboukleisioi, priests and deacons. The post was often combined with other offices in the ecclesiastical administration such as chartophylax or skeuophylax, but could also be held by monks."
 POLYCHRONION_GLOSS: "The Polychronion (Greek: Πολυχρόνιον, "many years") is a solemn encomium chanted in the liturgy of the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine churches. In the Roman rite, it is the equivalent of the liturgical acclamation Ad multos annos."
 SELLA_GLOSS: "Throne"
 PROSKYNESIS_GLOSS: "Proskynesis was a solemn gesture of respect towards gods and people in many societies. It was also one of the religious rites among both Greeks and Romans.\nIn Byzantine society, it was a common gesture of supplication or reverence. The physical act ranged from full-fledged prostration or alternatively genuflection, a bow, or a simple greeting that concretized the relative positions of performer and beneficiary within a hierarchical order."
 MAGISTROI_GLOSS: "The magister officiorum (Latin; lit. 'Master of Offices') was one of the most senior administrative officials in the Later Roman Empire and the early centuries of the Byzantine Empire."
 STRATEGOI_GLOSS: "Strategos, plural strategoi, Latinized strategus is used in Greek to mean military general. In the Hellenistic world and the Eastern Roman Empire the term was also used to describe a military governor. In the modern Hellenic Army, it is the highest officer rank."
 PROTOSPATHARIOI_GLOSS: "Prōtospatharios was one of the highest court dignities of the middle Byzantine period (8th to 12th centuries), awarded to senior generals and provincial governors, as well as to foreign princes."
 TAGMATA_GLOSS: "The tagma is a military unit of battalion or regiment size, especially the elite regiments formed by Byzantine emperor Constantine V and comprising the central army of the Byzantine Empire in the 8th–11th centuries."
